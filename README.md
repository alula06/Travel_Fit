Travel Fit
==========

Travel Fit is a web application running on Laravel, a PHP framework, that was developed with a few group members. Travel Fit was designed to allow users to search, rate, and review a variety of restaurants and other venues based on what we called a "Healthy Rating". Many people love to travel, but it can be rather unhealthy at times, and Travel Fit is a great solution to this problem.
